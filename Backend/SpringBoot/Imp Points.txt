1. Logger Declaration
	private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(UserAccountDAO.class);
	logger.info("UserAccountInfo size: {}", userAcctInfoList.size());
	
2. Springboot Starter Dependencies
	Spring Boot starter dependencies simplify the process of setting up a Spring Boot application by providing a set of commonly used dependencies and auto-configurations. These starter dependencies include pre-configured libraries and configurations that allow developers to get up and running quickly with common features like web development, data access, and security.
	
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-cache</artifactId>
	</dependency>


	a. spring-boot-starter-web -> For building web, RESTful, and web applications.
		Includes: Spring MVC, Tomcat as the default embedded container, Jackson for JSON binding, and other web-related dependencies.
	b. spring-boot-starter-jdbc -> Purpose: Provides support for JDBC operations and simplifies database interactions using the JdbcTemplate class.
		Includes spring-jdbc, which provides the core JDBC support and JdbcTemplate.
	c. spring-boot-starter-security -> Purpose: Provides a wide range of security features, including authentication and authorization, protection against common vulnerabilities, and more.
		Includes spring-security-core, spring-security-config, and other Spring Security modules.
	d. spring-boot-starter-parent -> Provides dependency management for Spring Boot and its related libraries.
		Specifies default versions for commonly used Spring Boot dependencies, so you don't have to specify the versions explicitly.
	e. spring-boot-starter-logging -> provides logging capabilities for Spring Boot applications. By default, it includes several essential logging libraries.
	f. spring-boot-starter-cache -> Caching can significantly improve the performance of your application by storing frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need for repeated computation or database queries.
	
	
	
	
3. `@Component` and `@Bean`	
	
In Spring Framework, both `@Component` and `@Bean` are used to define beans in the Spring application context, but they are used in **different ways** and **serve different purposes**.

	---

	### 🔹 `@Component`

	* **Used to mark a class** as a Spring-managed component (bean).
	* Spring automatically detects it during **component scanning**.

	#### Example:

	```java
	@Component
	public class MyService {
		public void doSomething() {
			System.out.println("Doing something...");
		}
	}
	```

	#### Usage:

	* Works with `@ComponentScan` to discover beans automatically.
	* Can also use specializations: `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`.

	#### When to use:

	* For application classes where **you control the source code**.
	* Simple and declarative — just annotate and go.

	---

	### 🔹 `@Bean`

	* **Used to define a bean method** inside a `@Configuration` class.
	* Spring calls the method and registers the returned object as a bean.

	#### Example:

	```java
	@Configuration
	public class AppConfig {

		@Bean
		public MyService myService() {
			return new MyService();
		}
	}
	```

	#### Usage:

	* Good for **third-party classes** or when you need **custom initialization logic**.
	* Full control over how the bean is created.

	#### When to use:

	* When you **cannot annotate** the class (e.g., from a library).
	* When you need to **customize dependencies manually** during bean creation.

	### 🔸 Summary Table

	| Feature     | `@Component`         | `@Bean`                                  |
	| ----------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
	| Target      | Class                | Method inside `@Configuration`           |
	| Detection   | Via `@ComponentScan` | Explicit via method return               |
	| Use case    | For your own classes | For third-party or complex bean creation |
	| Flexibility | Less control         | Full control over bean creation          |

	---

	### ✅ Rule of Thumb:

	* Use `@Component` for **simple, self-managed beans**.
	* Use `@Bean` when **manual creation or configuration** is needed.
