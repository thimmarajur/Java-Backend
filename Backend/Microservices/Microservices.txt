1.     InterService Communication
GetCustomerRequest request = new GetCustomerRequest();
    request.bosId = userAcctInfo.getBosID();
    String url = getAbtUrl(agencyId)+"getcustomerDetails";
    String action= AdminMytixConstant.USER_ADMIN+"getCustomerDetails";
    String method= AdminMytixConstant.USER_ADMIN+"_getCustomerDetails";
    HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
    headers.set("agencyId", agencyId);
    headers.set("apiKey", "1");
    if (agencyDB.getOracle().contains(agencyId)) {
          headers.set("apiKey", cache.getAppTypes().get(AdminMytixConstant.APP_TYPE_USER+"").getApi_key());
    }
    HttpEntity<Object> entity = new HttpEntity<>(request, headers);


masAdminResponse = restUtil.doRequest(url, entity, MasAdminResponse.class);



2.     API Gateway

Here’s a **clear, interview-friendly** explanation of **API Gateway** and **why we need it**, with examples you can use in microservices interviews.

---

# ✅ **What Is an API Gateway?**

**API Gateway is a single entry point** for all client requests in a microservices architecture.
Instead of a client calling multiple microservices directly, **all requests first go through the Gateway**, which then routes them to the appropriate service.

Think of it like a **front door** to all your backend services.

---

# ✅ **Why Do We Need an API Gateway?**

Below are the real reasons interviewers expect:

---

## **1. Single Entry Point for All Clients**

Without a gateway:

* Mobile app calls service A, B, C
* Web app calls service A, D
* Internal tools call service E

➡ Becomes messy, hard to maintain.

With API Gateway:

* All clients hit **ONE endpoint**.
* Gateway does the routing internally.

---

## **2. Reduces Client Complexity**

If a client has to call 5 services to show one screen → bad design.

Gateway can:

* Combine multiple service calls
  (**API Aggregation / Composition**)
* Return a single optimized response to the client

Example:
“Order Details Screen” may need:

* Order Service
* Payment Service
* Shipping Service

Gateway does all 3 calls → client gets one merged response.

---

## **3. Authentication and Authorization**

Instead of every microservice checking JWT tokens or API keys:

Gateway handles:

* Authentication (e.g., OAuth2, JWT)
* Authorization
* Token validation
* Rate limiting

Microservices stay lightweight.

---

## **4. Cross-Cutting Concerns**

Gateway centralizes logic like:

* Logging
* Request/Response transformation
* Rate limiting
* Caching
* Monitoring
* Security filtering
* IP whitelisting/blacklisting

This prevents code duplication across services.

---

## **5. Load Balancing & Routing**

Routes requests to the correct service instance.

Example:

```
/users → User Service  
/orders → Order Service  
/payments → Payment Service
```

If a service is down → Gateway can route to another instance.

---

## **6. Protocol Translation**

Clients communicate in HTTP/JSON, but services may use:

* REST
* gRPC
* AMQP
* Kafka

The Gateway can convert:

* HTTP → gRPC
* HTTP → Kafka message

This gives flexibility to backend teams.

---

## **7. Hides Internal Architecture**

Clients don’t need to know:

* How many services exist
* How many versions each service has
* Whether a service is migrated or split

You can change backend without affecting clients.

# 📌 **Example API Gateways**

* **Spring Cloud Gateway (Java)**
* **NGINX**
* **Kong**
* **Amazon API Gateway**
* **Apigee**
* **Zuul (legacy Netflix OSS)**

# 🎯 **Short and Perfect Interview Answer**

> **API Gateway is a single entry point for all client requests in a microservices system.
> It handles routing, authentication, rate limiting, logging, aggregation, and hides the internal architecture from clients.
> We need it to reduce client complexity, centralize cross-cutting concerns, improve security, and provide flexible routing and load balancing.**
