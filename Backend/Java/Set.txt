The Set interface is part of the Java Collections Framework and is used to store unique elements (no duplicates). Here's an overview and example of how to use it:

Key Points about Set:
	No Duplicates: A Set cannot contain duplicate elements.

	Unordered: Most implementations (like HashSet) do not guarantee any specific order of elements.

Common Implementations:

	HashSet: Stores elements in a hash table (fast access, no order).

	TreeSet: Stores elements in a sorted order (based on natural ordering or a custom comparator).

	LinkedHashSet: Maintains insertion order.
	
	
When to Use Which Implementation?
	HashSet: Use when you need fast access and don't care about order.

	TreeSet: Use when you need elements sorted.

	LinkedHashSet: Use when you need to maintain insertion order.
