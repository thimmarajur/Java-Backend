1. Private Constructor
	A constructor with private access modifier.

	Used to restrict object creation from outside the class.

	Commonly used in Singleton design patterns.
	
2. Static Blocks
	Static blocks are used to initialize static variables or perform one-time setup tasks for a class. They are executed when the class is loaded into memory, before any constructors or instance methods are called.

	Key Points:
	Static blocks are executed only once, regardless of how many objects are created.

	They are defined using the static keyword and a block of code {}.
	
	
3. Constructor in Abstract Classes
	Abstract classes can have constructors, even though they cannot be instantiated directly. These constructors are used to initialize fields or perform setup tasks for subclasses.

	Key Points:
	Abstract class constructors are called when a subclass object is created.

	They are useful for initializing common fields or enforcing constraints.
	
	
4. Constructor in Interfaces (Java 8+)
	Starting from Java 8, interfaces can have static methods and default methods, but they cannot have constructors. This is because interfaces cannot be instantiated directly.

	Alternative:
	Use abstract classes or factory methods if you need to enforce initialization logic.
	
	
5. Can a constructor be final, static, or abstract?
	final: No, a constructor cannot be final because it is not inherited.

	static: No, a constructor cannot be static because it is used to initialize instance variables.

	abstract: No, a constructor cannot be abstract because it must have a body to initialize the object.
	
	
6. How would you create an immutable class using constructors?

	Declare the class as final.

	Make all fields private and final.

	Initialize all fields in the constructor.

	Do not provide setter methods.
