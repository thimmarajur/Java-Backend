1. Private Constructor
	A constructor with private access modifier.

	Used to restrict object creation from outside the class.

	Commonly used in Singleton design patterns.
	
2. Static Blocks
	Static blocks are used to initialize static variables or perform one-time setup tasks for a class. They are executed when the class is loaded into memory, before any constructors or instance methods are called.

	Key Points:
	Static blocks are executed only once, regardless of how many objects are created.

	They are defined using the static keyword and a block of code {}.
	
	
3. Constructor in Abstract Classes
	Abstract classes can have constructors, even though they cannot be instantiated directly. These constructors are used to initialize fields or perform setup tasks for subclasses.

	Key Points:
	Abstract class constructors are called when a subclass object is created.

	They are useful for initializing common fields or enforcing constraints.
	
	
4. Constructor in Interfaces (Java 8+)
	Starting from Java 8, interfaces can have static methods and default methods, but they cannot have constructors. This is because interfaces cannot be instantiated directly.

	Alternative:
	Use abstract classes or factory methods if you need to enforce initialization logic.
	
	
5. Can a constructor be final, static, or abstract?
	final: No, a constructor cannot be final because it is not inherited.

	static: No, a constructor cannot be static because it is used to initialize instance variables.

	abstract: No, a constructor cannot be abstract because it must have a body to initialize the object.
	
	
6. How would you create an immutable class using constructors?
	Declare the class as final.
	Make all fields private and final.
	Initialize all fields in the constructor.
	Do not provide setter methods.

7.	What is Constructor Overloading?
	Constructor Overloading is the concept of having multiple constructors within the same class, as long as each constructor has a unique 	signature (a different number of parameters or different types/order of parameters). This allows an object to be initialized in 		various ways.

8.	What is Constructor Chaining?
	The process of a constructor calling another constructor within the same class (using this()) or calling a constructor of its 		immediate superclass (using super()). This is done to reuse initialization logic and ensure the proper initialization of the entire 	object hierarchy.

9.	Can a constructor be inherited?
	No, constructors are not inherited by subclasses. However, when an object of a subclass is created, the subclass constructor is 		responsible for explicitly or implicitly calling a constructor of its superclass (usually via super()).


10.	Constructor Chaining (super()) in Inheritance
	This demonstrates how constructors manage the initialization flow across the class hierarchy.

Java

					class Vehicle {
					    private int maxSpeed;
					
					    // Superclass Constructor
					    public Vehicle(int speed) {
					        this.maxSpeed = speed;
					        System.out.println("1. Vehicle constructor called. Speed: " + speed);
					    }
					}
					
					class Car extends Vehicle {
					    private String model;
					
					    // Subclass Constructor
					    public Car(String model, int speed) {
					        // Must be the first statement! It calls the Vehicle(int) constructor.
					        super(speed);
					        this.model = model;
					        System.out.println("2. Car constructor called. Model: " + model);
					    }
					}

	// When you execute: Car myCar = new Car("Sedan", 180);
	// Output will be:
	// 1. Vehicle constructor called. Speed: 180
	// 2. Car constructor called. Model: Sedan
	❓ Questions on Chaining
	In Example 2, what would happen if the super(speed); line was missing from the Car constructor?
	
	Answer: The compiler would try to insert the implicit call super(); as the first line. Since the Vehicle class does not have a no-argument constructor, the compilation would fail with a compile-time error.
	
	When an object of the Car class is instantiated, in what order are the fields initialized and the constructor bodies executed?
	
	Answer:
	
	Superclass Instance Variables are initialized to their default values (e.g., maxSpeed to 0).
	
	Superclass Constructor Body (Vehicle(int speed)) is executed.
	
	Subclass Instance Variables are initialized to their default values (e.g., model to null).
	
	Subclass Constructor Body (Car(String model, int speed)) is executed.

11.	Chaining with this() and Implicit super()What is the output of the following code?Javaclass A {
							public A() {
							        System.out.println("A's default constructor.");
							    }
							}
							
							class B extends A {
							    public B(String s) {
							        System.out.println("B's parameterized constructor: " + s);
							    }
							    
							    public B() {
							        this("Hello");
							        System.out.println("B's default constructor.");
							    }
							}
							
							public class OutputTest {
							    public static void main(String[] args) {
							        B b = new B();
							    }
							}
Output -
		A's default constructor.
		B's parameterized constructor: Hello
		B's default constructor
Explanation
	1. The new B() call invokes B() (the default constructor).B's parameterized constructor: Hello
	2. Inside B(), the first statement is this("Hello"), which calls B(String s).
	3. Inside B(String s), the first statement is the implicit super(), which calls the no-argument constructor of the superclass, 				A().B's default constructor.
	4. After A() finishes, B(String s) finishes printing its output.
	5. Finally, the original constructor, B(), finishes printing its output.


12.	Constructor Order with Instance Initializer Block
	What is the output of the following code?

							class Parent {
							    { System.out.println("2. Parent instance initializer."); } // Instance Initializer Block
							
							    public Parent() {
							        System.out.println("3. Parent constructor.");
							    }
							}
							
							class Child extends Parent {
							    { System.out.println("5. Child instance initializer."); }
							
							    public Child() {
							        System.out.println("6. Child constructor.");
							    }
							}
							
							public class OutputTest2 {
							    public static void main(String[] args) {
							        Child c = new Child();
							    }
							}

Output -
		2. Parent instance initializer.	
		3. Parent constructor.
		5. Child instance initializer.	
		6. Child constructor.
Explanation -
	1. Implicit super() is called in Child().
	2. The order of execution in the parent is: super() call (implicit/explicit) -> Instance Initializer Blocks -> Constructor Body.
	3. After the parent is fully constructed, the child's instance initializer block runs.	
	4. Finally, the rest of the Child() constructor body executes.

		 2️⃣ No return type allowed
		 3️⃣ If no constructor → Java provides default
		 4️⃣ If any constructor exists → no default provided
		 5️⃣ Constructors can’t be static, final, abstract
		 6️⃣ Use this() to call another constructor in the same class
		 7️⃣ Use super() to call superclass constructor
		 8️⃣ First line must be this() or super() (if used)
