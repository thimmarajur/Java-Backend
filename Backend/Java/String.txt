1. String and String Constant Pool in Java
	In Java, String is an immutable class used to represent sequences of characters. Java optimizes memory usage for strings through a String Constant Pool.

	a. Why is String Immutable?
		✅ Security – Prevents modification of sensitive strings like passwords.
		✅ Caching & Performance – Enables reuse in the String Constant Pool.
		✅ Thread Safety – Immutable strings avoid synchronization issues.
		✅ Efficient HashCode Caching – Hashcodes are cached for faster lookups.
		
	String s1 = "Hello"; // Stored in String Constant Pool
	String s2 = "Hello"; // Reuses the same object from the pool
	System.out.println(s1 == s2); // true (Both refer to the same memory location)
	
	String s3 = new String("Hello"); // Stored in heap memory
	String s4 = new String("Hello");
	System.out.println(s3 == s4); // false (Different objects in heap)
	
	String s = "Java" + "World"; // Optimized at compile-time
	String a = "Java";
	String b = "World";
	String c = a + b; // Creates a new object in heap
	System.out.println(s == c); // false (c is in heap, s is in SCP)
	
	
	String x = new String("World"); // Stored in heap
	String y = x.intern(); // Moves "World" to SCP
	String z = "World"; // Already in SCP
	System.out.println(x == y); // false (x is in heap, y is in SCP)
	System.out.println(y == z); // true (Both refer to the same SCP object)
	The intern() method ensures that a string is added to the string pool (if not already present) and returns a reference to the pooled string.
	


2. StringBuffer vs StringBuilder
	
	In Java, StringBuffer and StringBuilder are classes used to create and manipulate mutable sequences of characters. They are similar in functionality but differ in terms of thread safety and performance. Below is a detailed comparison:

	Key Differences
		Feature				StringBuffer							StringBuilder
		Thread Safety		Thread-safe (synchronized)				Not thread-safe (not synchronized)
		Performance			Slower due to synchronization			Faster due to lack of synchronization
		Introduced In		Java 1.0								Java 1.5
		Use Case			Multi-threaded environments				Single-threaded environments
		
	1. StringBuffer
		Thread Safety: StringBuffer is thread-safe, meaning its methods are synchronized. This ensures that only one thread can access the object at a time.

		Performance: Due to synchronization, StringBuffer is slower than StringBuilder.

		Use Case: Use StringBuffer when working in a multi-threaded environment where thread safety is required.
		
	2. StringBuilder
		Thread Safety: StringBuilder is not thread-safe, meaning its methods are not synchronized. This makes it faster but unsuitable for multi-threaded environments.

		Performance: Due to the lack of synchronization, StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer.

		Use Case: Use StringBuilder in single-threaded environments where performance is critical.
		
		
	Common Methods
		Both StringBuffer and StringBuilder provide the same methods for manipulating strings:

		append(): Adds text to the end of the sequence.

		insert(): Inserts text at a specified position.

		delete(): Removes characters from the sequence.

		reverse(): Reverses the sequence.

		toString(): Converts the sequence to a String.
