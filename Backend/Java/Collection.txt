1.  Comparator vs Comparable
	In Java, both Comparator and Comparable are interfaces used to sort collections of objects. However, they serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios. Here's a detailed comparison:

	Comparable
		Purpose: The Comparable interface is used to define the natural ordering of objects. It allows a class to compare its instances with other instances of the same class.

		Interface: java.lang.Comparable

		Method: int compareTo(T obj)

			This method compares the current object (this) with the specified object (obj).

		Returns: 
			A negative integer if this is less than obj.

			Zero if this is equal to obj.

			A positive integer if this is greater than obj.

		Usage: A class implements Comparable to define its natural order. For example, String and Integer implement Comparable to provide a natural ordering.
		
	Comparator
		Purpose: The Comparator interface is used to define custom ordering for objects. It is useful when you want to sort objects in a way that is different from their natural order or when the class does not implement Comparable.

		Interface: java.util.Comparator

		Method: int compare(T obj1, T obj2)

			This method compares two objects (obj1 and obj2).

		Returns:

			A negative integer if obj1 is less than obj2.

			Zero if obj1 is equal to obj2.

			A positive integer if obj1 is greater than obj2.

		Usage: A Comparator is typically implemented as a separate class or using a lambda expression. It allows you to define multiple ways to sort objects.
		
		Collections.sort(numbers, Comparator.reverseOrder()); (for Integer , String List)
		
		Collections.sort(people, (p1, p2) -> p2.name.compareTo(p1.name));
		people.sort(Comparator.comparing(Person::getName).reversed());



2.	HashMap vs. HashSet – What Sets Them Apart?
	In Java, HashMap and HashSet are both part of the Java Collections Framework, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here's a detailed comparison of the two:

	1. Purpose
		HashMap:

			A key-value pair based collection.

			Used to store and retrieve data in the form of key-value mappings.

			Implements the Map interface.

		HashSet:

			A set based collection.

			Used to store unique elements (no duplicates allowed).

			Implements the Set interface.

	2. Underlying Data Structure
		HashMap:

			Backed by a hash table.

			Uses hashing to store and retrieve key-value pairs.

		HashSet:

			Internally uses a HashMap to store elements.

			Only the keys of the HashMap are used, and the values are set to a dummy object (e.g., PRESENT).

	3. Duplicates
		HashMap:

			Allows duplicate values but not duplicate keys.

			If a duplicate key is inserted, the existing value is replaced.

		HashSet:

			Does not allow duplicate elements.

			If a duplicate element is added, it is ignored.

	4. Null Values
		HashMap:

			Allows one null key and multiple null values.

		HashSet:

			Allows one null element.

	5. Ordering
		HashMap:

			Does not maintain any order of elements (unordered).

			Use LinkedHashMap if insertion order is required.

		HashSet:

			Does not maintain any order of elements (unordered).

			Use LinkedHashSet if insertion order is required.

	6. Performance
		HashMap:

			Provides O(1) time complexity for basic operations (get, put, remove) on average.

			Performance depends on the quality of the hash function and the load factor.

		HashSet:

			Provides O(1) time complexity for basic operations (add, remove, contains) on average.

			Since it is backed by a HashMap, its performance is similar to HashMap.

	7. Methods
		HashMap:

			Key methods: put(K key, V value), get(Object key), remove(Object key), containsKey(Object key), keySet(), values(), entrySet().

		HashSet:

			Key methods: add(E e), remove(Object o), contains(Object o), iterator().

	8. Use Cases
		HashMap:

			Used when you need to store and retrieve data based on keys.

			Example: Storing user profiles with usernames as keys.

		HashSet:

			Used when you need to store a collection of unique elements.

			Example: Storing a list of unique words from a document.
