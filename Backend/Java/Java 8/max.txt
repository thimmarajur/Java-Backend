Scenario						Best Approach
Find max number					max(Integer::compareTo)
Find longest string				max(Comparator.comparingInt(String::length))
Find max object property		max(Comparator.comparingDouble(Class::method))
Find most frequent element		groupingBy() + max(Map.Entry.comparingByValue())
Find second highest				sorted().skip(1).findFirst()
Find max in matrix				flatMapToInt(Arrays::stream).max()



🔎 Key Points to Remember
✅ max() returns an Optional<T>, so use .orElse() or .orElseThrow().
✅ Use Comparator.comparing(Function) when working with objects.
✅ Use mapToInt() for primitive types (int, double, long).
✅ Use .sorted().skip(1) for second max values.
✅ Use .groupingBy() + max() for frequency-based problems.
